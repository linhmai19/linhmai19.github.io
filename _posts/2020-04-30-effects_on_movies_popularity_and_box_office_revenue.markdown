Since it was invented in the 19th century, motion pictures have become one of the most popular types of entertainment outside of the home. In the past, people usually came together to the theater to enjoy a movie on a big screen with special sound and effect which were hardly found at home. However, nowadays, with the fast development of technology, people can easily turn their own homes to a comfortable home theater. According to a research post in 2016 by Stephen Follows who is a film data researcher, only about 51% of Hollywood movies make a profit. Moreover, according to a more recent analysis on Forbes, most films, about 80%, lose money. Therefore, to have a great piece of the film industry “pie”, there are many factors that influence a movie’s popularity and profit to take into consideration before making a Hollywood movie.

A handful of datasets from Box Office Mojo, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and TheMovieDB.org were given to provide various types of information about the film industry: from movie names, release date, film crews to genres, production cost, and total gross. The answer to the question that we want to obtain from these datasets is what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. The datasets contain information about movies from as long as 1930. First of all, the audiences are 2 or 3 generations different than now. Therefore, it leads to the second point is that the movie types that are preferred nowadays are also different than in the last century. With those being said, this analysis will be constrained to the recent decade only to make the results more accurate and up-to-date. For the initial analysis, I want to seek the answers to whether release date, movie genre, production cost, and movie duration take a significant role in a movie’s popularity and profit.

As stated briefly above, I will extract the data for movies from the year 2000 to 2018. To do that, firstly, I need to convert the data files into a readable format. Because each of the datasets contains a large amount of data, there is certainly a lot of messy and uncleaned data. Doubtlessly, using these data straightly without cleaning will do more harm than good and of course will lead to inaccurate conclusions. The very next step after importing data files is to clean the data to deal with missing values, incorrect format values, and put away any unnecessary values. Some of the values are not in its correct forms such as release date, production cost, worldwide gross is presented as text. The release date text was converted into a date-time format first before using any conditional command later to select movies from 2000 to 2018. The money related data such as production cost and gross were converted from text form into integer form for calculating, analyzing, and visualizing. With the missing values, I needed to deal with it case by case to minimize any influences on the distribution of the variable or bias results as much as possible. For missing values in a column that are less than 5%, compared to the whole dataset, I decided to drop them. For null values that occupy about 10% to 20% amount of the dataset, I replaced them with the median value for that column. However, for instance, the genre column has more than 30% of missing values, I kept them by replacing them with a string called “No Defined” and also treated it as its category. Nonetheless, on the route of gathering data, it is also common that not everything is relevant to the current research purposes. These columns do not add any valuable contribution to the project and also very abundant or confusing to the audience. For instance, in a dataset from IMDB, there are columns for movie titles but there is also another column that contains alphanumeric unique identifiers of the movie titles. This information may be useful in the IMDB database, but it is not useful when combining with datasets from other databases.  One dataset might contain one piece of information, and the other dataset contains another useful piece of information. In the next step after cleaning data, I converted these datasets into SQL tables and combine them into my SQL database to easy comparison or making any analysis.


### FINAL RESULTS

Based on the data of movies from the year 2000 to 2018, the most popular time in the year to release a movie is in February, July, August, November, and December. However, the most profitable months to have movie premiere are during the summer break: May, June, and July, and during the Holiday season: November and December. It is common to see that the movie premiere takes place on Friday and it shows that through the analysis. Nevertheless, releasing a movie on a Wednesday or Thursday will bring more profit: 167% more than a Tuesday or 54% more than a Friday.

The genre of a movie is one of the most important factors that influences a movie’s popularity and profit. According to the top 300 movies that are the most popular and profitable in the recent decade, the common genre categories in order are action, adventure, drama, comedy, and sci-fi. The result is also a confirmation that the decision of choosing only analyzing the movie data in the recent decade is more accurate. Many decades ago, sci-fi movies were on top of the list as it dazzled most of the people because it might be about the future. However, nowadays, as technology is much more advanced and people get used to it daily, sci-fi is no longer greatly wondrous. As a result, it is only the last in the top five movie genres. If we included the data from a long time ago, the result would come out differently and not very accurate. 

In order to create a great movie and make sure a lot of people know about it, production cost plays an essential role in affecting a movie’s success. The analysis result proved that there is a positive correlation between the production budget and popularity with a value of 0.57 and profitability with a value of 0.69. I also found the average production cost based on the popularity is about $108 million and the minimum cost is $1 million. On the other hand, based on the profitability, the average production cost is higher: $120 million and the minimum cost is also higher: $3 million. 

The final factor that I want to test on is the duration of a movie. The analysis result shows that there is little to no correlation between the movie runtime and the popularity as well as the profitability. As I was doing the analysis, I found that there are some outliers that way more outstanding, compared to most of the data values, so I set a limit for the runtime to less than 300 minutes. After that, the average runtime of the top 300 recent movies that are the most popular and profitable was calculated to be about 115 to 120 minutes.

### FUTURE ANALYSIS

Making a Hollywood movie and attracting investors into it is not as easy as saying. It involves a much deeper analysis. Therefore, this data analysis is only the initial phase of understanding the film industry. There are some other factors that also greatly influence a movie’s success. For instance, which celebrities are starred in that movie, is the movie from big-six studios like Disney, Warner Bros, Universal, Paramount, Sony, and Fox, who is the director or which film crew is involved?
